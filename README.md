# Create-a-Subnet

Setting up an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) subnet on the Avalanche network for a project like a DeFi Kingdom clone requires careful planning and execution. Below is a step-by-step guide that outlines the process from start to finish, including deploying your own EVM subnet, creating a native currency, and connecting to MetaMask. Additionally, you will deploy the basic building blocks for your game using Solidity and Remix. Let's break down each step for clarity:

### 1. Deploy Your EVM Subnet Using the Avalanche CLI

1. **Install Avalanche CLI**: First, ensure you have the Avalanche command-line interface tool installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the Avalanche documentation website.

2. **Create Subnet**: Use the Avalanche CLI to create your custom EVM subnet. This involves generating a new subnet on the Avalanche network.

3. **Configure Subnet**: Customize your subnet's settings, including its validators, to meet the requirements of your project.

### 2. Add Your Subnet to MetaMask

1. **MetaMask Configuration**: After creating your subnet, you need to add it as a custom network in MetaMask. This involves inputting your subnet's RPC URL and chain ID into MetaMask's network configuration settings.

2. **Select Network**: Ensure your newly added subnet is selected as the active network in MetaMask.

### 3. Connect Remix to Your MetaMask

1. **Access Remix**: Open Remix IDE in your web browser. Remix is a powerful tool for developing and testing Ethereum smart contracts.

2. **MetaMask Connection**: In Remix, set the environment to "Injected Web3" which allows Remix to connect directly to your MetaMask wallet.

### 4. Deploy the Smart Contracts

1. **Write Contracts**: Use Solidity to write the smart contracts for your game. This includes contracts for game mechanics such as battling, exploring, trading, liquidity pools, and your native currency.

2. **Compile Contracts**: In Remix, compile your smart contracts to check for any errors and to prepare them for deployment.

3. **Deploy Contracts**: Still in Remix, deploy your contracts to your EVM subnet through MetaMask. Ensure you have enough of your subnet's native currency in your MetaMask wallet to cover deployment gas fees.

### 5. Test Your Application

1. **Interact with Contracts**: Use Remix to call functions on your deployed smart contracts. This is to ensure they behave as expected.

2. **Debugging**: Should you encounter any issues, use Remix's debugging tools to troubleshoot.

### 6. Further Development

- **Deploy Additional Features**: Beyond the basic building blocks, consider deploying additional smart contracts for new game features.
- **Frontend Development**: Develop a user-friendly frontend for your game, allowing players to interact with your smart contracts via a web interface.

Remember, this is a high-level overview, and each step involves significant detail, especially when coding smart contracts and setting up the subnet. Always refer to the latest Avalanche documentation for the most up-to-date information and practices.
